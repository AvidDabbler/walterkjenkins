        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="para-box" id="about-box">     
            <p>Walter has been working in transit and government technology since 2012. He has been a voice in government tech to encourage leadership that technology will bridge the gap between its workers and citizens. He belives that through good design barriers of all kinds can be broken down to better communicate projects and initiatives to citizens and elected officials. </p>

            <p>Having experience in Transit Operations, Planning, and Information Technology, Walter has a unique background that comes with a well rounded understanding of the industry and pitfalls of transit technologies. He has a track record of being able to analyze and leverage data to preform analysis and build applications that have improved workflows and communication</p>

            <p>Starting in North Carolina Walter worked for a Transportation Authority as a Transportation Planner. He maintained a hand built GTFS feed using GIS and preformed performance and socioeconomic analysis. His methods looking at origin destination data led to a overhaul of the transit system that saw a direct increase in ridership and customer satisfaction.</p>

            <p>Walter is available for contract work, consuliting, and projects and can bring his expertise to your projects.</p>

        <h1>Work</h1>
        <div class="para-box" id="about-box">     
                <p>Being a transit technology professional with a background in Operations and Planning Walter has been spearheading projects since 2012. Whether the data is being pulled out of Trapeze or needs to be created Walter has a successful track record of getting a project done that has worked with peoples needs for the entire agency.</p>

                <p>Working with ArcGIS Pro he has been able to build tools to process data for consumption by Trapeze and has pulled together models to translate road centerline data for consumption by Trapeze's MapMaker.</p>

                <p>While working for Metro Saint Louis Walter was in charge of getting a way for the operations planners to be able to review 7,500 stops in a number of months. Given that there was a limited amount of time, Walter implemented an ArcGIS a workflow for the planners using ArcGIS Web App Builder that integrated Google Street View. This workflow kept the project running smoothly and allowed for the planners to analyze the stops from the office in a short amount of time.</p>

                <p>Currently Walter is working on a project where he is building a Bus Stop Management System by combining Web App Builder and Survey123. This integration would create a customer to completion solution that would allow for the streamline of data collection from the customer that would route its way through the agency using the full suite of ArcGIS Workforce products. At the end of the project the process will run without the need for writing emails and a system of documentation will be established for the assessment of new stop locations and a detailed documentation of the construction of each bus stop install.</p>
